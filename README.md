# Bagel Arena
Bagel Arena was a fast-paced first person shooter based off of the Quake games designed inside of the Roblox engine. I made this game in around 15 days. 

As of right now it all functions, except I would prefer to get some comments and explain everything to the best of my ability, so that is my current goal. I wanted to put this out here for people to learn from and enjoy.1
